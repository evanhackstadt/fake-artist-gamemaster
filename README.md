# Fake Artist Gamemaster
A web app that automatically facilitates the hidden role game "A Fake Artist Goes to New York"

**DISCLAIMER:** This is a low-code project that utilizes ChatGPT extensively to generate code. While I still learned a lot, much of this code was NOT written by me.

### Purpose:
The card game "[A Fake Artist Goes to New York](https://oinkgames.com/en/games/analog/a-fake-artist-goes-to-new-york/)" is a fun hidden-role game, but requires the facilitation of a gamemaster (GM). It recommends 5-10 players. Thus, in a small group (e.g. a family of 4), this is far from ideal, and simple workarounds are cumbersome.
This web app seeks to automate the GM role, allowing everyone in a group of 4 to play the game in a streamlined manner.
